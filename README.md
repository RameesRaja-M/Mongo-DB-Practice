MongoDB Practice - Library Database
This repository contains my practice exercises with MongoDB, specifically focusing on the Library Database. The database includes a Books collection, where each document represents a book with the following fields:

Title: Name of the book
Author: The author of the book
Published Year: Year the book was published
Genre: Genre of the book (e.g., Money)
Operations Practiced:
I have solved five different operations using MongoDB Shell. These include:

Create Operation:

Adding new books to the collection.
Read Operation:

Querying books from the collection using various filters and conditions.
Update Operation:

Modifying the details of an existing book (e.g., updating the year or genre).
Delete Operation:

Deleting books from the collection based on certain conditions.
Advanced Query:

Performing complex queries, such as aggregations or using multiple operators for more sophisticated data retrieval.
Each operation is implemented with a corresponding MongoDB shell command to demonstrate the functionality and potential of MongoDB for managing data.
